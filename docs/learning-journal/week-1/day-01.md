# Week 1, Day 1 - Project Setup

**Date:** 2024-XX-XX (replace with today's date)

## 🎯 What I Worked On Today

1. Installed VS Code and essential extensions
2. Set up Node.js, Git, AWS CLI, SAM CLI, and Docker
3. Created AWS account with billing alerts
4. Created GitHub repository
5. Set up professional project structure

## 💡 What I Learned

### Development Environment

- VS Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used by professionals
- Extensions add functionality (AWS Toolkit, GitLens, etc.)
- The terminal is where you run commands

### Git & Version Control

- `git init` - Initialize a repository
- `git remote add origin` - Connect local folder to GitHub
- `.gitignore` - Tells Git which files to ignore

### AWS Fundamentals

- Root account vs IAM user (IAM is safer for daily use)
- Access keys are like username/password for CLI
- Billing alerts prevent surprise charges
- `us-east-1` is the most common region

## 🤔 What Confused Me

- (Write anything that was unclear)

## 🔗 DVA-C02 Connection

Today's setup connects to several exam topics:

- **IAM**: Creating users, policies, access keys
- **AWS CLI**: Configuration and usage
- **Regions**: Understanding us-east-1 as default
- **Security**: Best practices for credential management

## ✅ Tomorrow's Goals

- [ ] Make first commit
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Start building the SAM template

## 🎉 Small Win

I have a professional development environment set up from scratch!
